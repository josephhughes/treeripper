= I get an error "dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libMagick++.4.dylib" on MacOS X =

The problem lies in the architecture:i386 versus x86_64 and the delegate libraries for ImageMagick need to have the right architecture.

This is a problem related to the different architectures under which libMagick++ and treeripper have been compiled. You need to compile libtiff, freetype, libpng, jpeg, zlib from source. You can find most of these, here:
http://www.imagemagick.org/download/delegates/
Then compile ImageMagick from source on you particular OS and then recompile TreeRipper and this should solve the problem. 

= I get an "image not found" error = 

dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib 
Referenced from: /Volumes/Data/TreeRipper1_1/src/./treeripper
Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap

This is a related issue to the previous problem, make sure you have installed freetype and libtiff from source for your computer's architecture
